# Service Strategy

Decide on a strategy to serve the people,
which services to offer and what capabilities to develop

* See the service design in the
  [service platform wiki](https://github.com/sakaal/service_platform_ansible/wiki).

## Mission statement

We develop a digital social system for the people.

## Purpose

The purpose of this digital social system is to foster a
responsible, pluralistic, democratic, open, and primarily cooperative
communications platform for online integrated
long-term persistent publishing and short-term transient messaging experience.

* Foster open and independent communications between people.
  Allow people share what information they want in their own name,
  understanding that they maintain responsibility of what they share
  and how they share it, and are subject to applicable regulations
  depending on jurisdictions where the communication originates,
  is reproduced, consumed or used.

* Let people agree, regardless of medium,
  on the intellectual property rights to their creations
  and licensing of their use and distribution within the extent allowed by law.
  Every message that is shared has a legal notice
  explaining the terms of its use.
  Modular licensing management observes relevant intellectual property rights,
  their expiration, forfeiture, limits of applicability or inapplicability
  depending on jurisdiction, and allows their articulate and effective
  communication.

* Long-term retention is based on maintaining the integrity of chains of
  permanent references to earlier works and messages.
  Copies are kept available for as long as anyone is maintaining
  permanent references either directly or via chains of references.
  Unused references may be ignored in order to accommodate
  for possible storage constraints.

* Controversial communications by some people should not expose others
  (for example, providers of the communications service instances)
  to levels of risk (social, legal, or otherwise) that they have not
  accepted themselves. If a person intends to engage in communications
  for a cause that they believe in, even if it involves elements
  that may contradict regulations in some jurisdictions,
  they must do so without implicating others of possible violations
  (for example, by using their provided service instance).

* Develop sophisticated negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms.
  People may choose which comments of others they accept hosted under
  their own name. Anyone can publish further comments on the same,
  but under their own name. People may register their public comments
  to what anyone has published, and the public reactions index
  (per published item) is freely searchable.

* Foster consensus-forming processes seeking without enforcing consensus.
  Allow communicating the level of consensus.

* Foster a decentralized online communication network that
  can be maintained between peers, regardless of affiliation
  or lack of affiliation. The infrastructure requirements
  for a service instance must be manageable for a single person
  or a small group of private individuals, based on modular architecture
  and open source or commodity hardware and software components
  independent of any single vendor.

* A dynamic web of trust in conjunction with cryptographic and optionally
  biometric authentication methods shall provide adequate levels of
  long-term verifiability, tamper resistance, and information security.
  The web of trust will also help resisting attempts to delay, divert,
  confuse, or prevent sincere communications. Modular architecture
  facilitates adaptation to evolving multiple factor authentication methods.

* In order for the network to remain decentralized, both in theory and
  in practice, both socially and technologically, the network must remain
  independent of the concept of centralized ownership. Individual service
  instances may have ownership, but the overall network must resist all
  attempts of any entity or coalition gaining centralized control.
